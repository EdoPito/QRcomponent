## Overview

### Links

## My process

I added some semantics to the HTML, used article and role, as it makes the website more accessible.

Fisrt resetted the whole document and set the box-sizing so that my boxes height and width don't change by adding padding/margin. 

I then set the body as a flex container so I could center the card without using paddings and margins, this is the first time I used this set-up. 

Once I had my card made that a flex container so that I could column the content, used percentages for the picture and the text article container. 

Styled accordingly. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

Learned about semantic and adding experience on flexbox. 



### Continued development

Need to get a better understanding of using percentages, and I will keep using flexbox to refine my skills.
